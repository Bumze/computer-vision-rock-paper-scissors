# Computer Vision RPS
# Overview of the project
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three images representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. This is an implementation of an interactive "Rock Paper Scissors" game in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

# Milestone 1
For this milestone, I used Teachable Machines, a web-based tool for machine learning models to train a model with images. The model can recognise four different image categories: Rock, Paper, Scissors or Nothing. Then, I have downloaded this trained model to my local machine.
